## Services Overview

We are going to look at the entire AWS Platform and overview of individual services. And also talk about if those individual services would be relevant for the exam or not.

Sorry - this is going to be a wall of text, after this its more hands on.

If you log into the console, you'll see the sections of each services, for example Compute, Storage, Database, etc. And each of this sections would have individual services, for example Compute will have services like EC2, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk, etc. 

This section, we will talk about each services.

**Compute**

- EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud. Virtual machines inside of AWS platform.

- EC2 Container Service - Run and manage Docker Container at scale

- Elastic Beanstalk - Developers who don't understand AWS, upload your code and it will take care of auto scaling and creating of EC2 instances, etc. Just upload your code and they'll take care of everything.

- Lambda - Code that you upload to the cloud and controll when it executes. You don't have to worry about any physical or virutal machines or OS (security, updates, etc.). All you do is upload your code and decide when to run it.

- Lightsail - VPS (virtual private service), for somebody who really doesn't want to understand any of the AWS infrastructure, and this will provision a server, give you a fixed private IP, and give you RDP/SSH access. And has an easy management console.

- Batch - Used for batch computing (not covered in any exams).

**Storage**

- S3 - Simple Storage Service. Object based store, you have buckets and upload your files in them.

- EFS - Elastic File System. Network attached storage, go in and store files on an EFS volume and can mount it on multiple virtual machines (EC2 instances**.

- Glacier - Data archiving service. Throw stuff at it that you only use once every couple years.

- Snowball - They send a giant box where you can transfer your data and return them. And they'll put it on cloud for you. Local transfer is faster than one over the internet.

- Snowmobile - They actually bring in a truck with secured guards on your premise to transfer data.

- Storage Gateway - Virtual machines for local on promise storage that replicates the data to cloud.

**Database**

- RDS - Relational Database Service. Includes MySQL, Microsoft SQL, AWS Aurora, postgreSQL, etc.

- DynamoDB - NoSQL database service

- Elasticache - Caching commonly queried things. For example, for a store, cache top 10 products and pull it from here instead of database. It's quicker response and frees up your database to do other queries.

- Red Shift - Data warehousing and business intelligence. 

**Migration**

- AWS Migration Hub - Tracking service, track your application while you migrate to AWS.

- Application Discovery Service - Automated set of tools and detects your application and its dependencies. For example, a service like node app, it would detects the database service you are using and the dependencies specified in package.json file and will track it for you.

- Database Migration Service - Oracle hated this. This service visualizes the database migration.

- Server Migration Service - Migrate physical servers to AWS

Migration is not that important for the exam.

**Networking and Content Delivery**

- VPC - Virtual Private Cloud. Virtual data center, configure firewall, AZ, network CIDR address ranges, route tables, ACL, etc. This is important and we'll talk more about this later. 

- CloudFront - Content Delievery Network. Think of media assets (video and images** and if your servers are in US AZ and you have users in Australia, CloudFront will store these assets in Australia for quick delivery.

- Route53 - DNS service

- API Gateway - Way of creating your own API for your other services to talk to. Important and talk about this later.

- Direct Connect - A way of running dedicated line from your local office and directly to AWS and connect to your VPC.

**Developer Tools**

Not a single service is featured in the exam, ain't that funny?

- CodeStar - A way of getting a group of devs working collaboratively. A way to manage your code base. You set up code and have a continous delivery tool chain.

- CodeCommit - A place to store your code. Source Control, like Github and Bitbucket.

- CodeBuild - Once you have your code ready, it will run tests for you and produce software packages that are ready for deployment. Its like CI (continuous integration**.

- CodeDeploy - Deployment service that deploys your code to EC2 instances, lambda and local servers.

- CodePipeline - Continuous delivery service that visualizes the steps needed to release your code

- X-Ray - Debug and analyze your serverless application. It has request tracing to find root causes and resource bottlenecks.

- Cloud9 - Online IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

**Management Tools**

- CloudWatch - Monitoring Service.

- CloudFormation - Templating service to provision infrastructure. Let's you do anything you want on AWS using scripts.

- CloudTrail - Tracks everything you do on AWS. From creating an EC2 instance to S3 bucket changes, CloudTrail will capture everything you do on AWS.

- Config - Monitors the configuration of your entire AWS and has point in time snapshots so you can revert easily.

- OpsWorks - Similar to ElasticBeanstalk, uses shift and puppet to manages configuration of your environment.

- Service Catalog - Manage Catalog of Proof of Concepts to use on AWS (bigger companies requires these catalogs).

- Systems Manager - Interface for managing AWS resources, patch maintainance, group resources by departments and appplications (finance dept., marketing dept., etc**.

- Trusted Advisor - It will give you advice behind difference disciplines. Open ports, to saving money, etc. Like an attorney, gives advice on all AWS services in your best interest.

- Managed Services - Managed service, they'll take care it for you.

**Media Services**

- Elastic Transcoder - Takes videos and resizes to different aspect ratios.

- MediaConvert - Video on demand for broadcast

- MediaLive - Video streams, creates streams for different devices TV, smartphones, setup boxes, etc.

- MediaPackage - Prepares and protects the videos

- MediaStore - Storage service optimized for media

- MediaTailor - Targeted advertising into video streams when broadcasting, etc.

**Machine Learning**

- SageMaker - Makes it easy for devs to use deep learning when basically coding for their environment. 

- Comprehend - Sentiment analysis around data, weather or not people are saying good or bad things around your product.

- DeepLens - Artifically aware camera, it can self configure what it is looking at. There is not backend and does it on the camera itself

- Lex - Powers amazon's alexa service, communicating with customers. AI way of chatting with customers

- Machine Learning - Different than deep learning (sagemaker). Much more entry level than deep learning -> throw a data set and it will analyze

- Polly - Takes text and turns it into speech. (Really cool, no robo talk, some real shit!**

- Rekognition - Video and images - upload a file and it will tell you what's in that file. Dog playing on a beach and gives you accuracy %.
