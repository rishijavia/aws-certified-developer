**What is a Region?**

A region is geographical area. Each Region consists of 2 (or more** Availability Zones. Example: Orgeon, N. Virginia, Sydney, etc.

**What is an Availability Zone (AZ)?**

An availability zone is simply a data center. You want to put your resources in multiple AZs, so you still have your data if one of them get hits by the floods.

**What is an Edge Location?**

Edge Locations are endpoints for AWS which are used for chaching content. Typically this consists of CloudFront, Amazon's Content Delivery Network (CDN**. We'll create our own CDN soon.

There are more edge locations than regions -- 96.

**For Exam:**

Understand the difference between a region, an AZ and an Edge Location

- A region is a physical location in the world which consists of two or more AZs.

- An AZ is one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking and connectivity, housed in sperate facilities.

- Edge Locations are endpoints for AWS which are used for caching content. Typically this consists of CloudFront, Amazon's Content Delivery Network (CDN).
